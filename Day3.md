## Day 3: Preparing Data

Today, we continue with our workflow. First, we prepare a raw data so that we can start exploring. We discuss how to parse, filter and extract information from our data sets. Once acquired, data is hardly ever in the shape and structure that we need to answer our research questions. There are several steps needed to transform the data, before we can query, represent and visualise it. During the transformations, new insights and questions may come up that require us to go back to previous steps. We use Google Refine and Gephi to explore data sets created during the first day.
