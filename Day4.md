## Day 4: Telling Data

This session focuses on analysis of digital text. The first part, taught by Karina van Dalen-Oskam, will start with a short overview of the main sources of available digital texts in the Dutch language. Then some of the most accessible text analysis tools will be demonstrated. One of these, AntConc, will be dealt with more thoroughly. For this, participants are advised to bring a small set of digital texts they would like to experiment with. These should be in txt-format (if necessary, we will help you to convert your file to the right format). NB: The teachers will also bring some texts for experimenting.

In the second part, taught by Jelle Zuidema, we will focus on regular expressions as a more general and even more powerful way to search for patterns in text data. We will use the Cygwin-environment (providing a so-called unix-shell that runs on Windows) to practice with simple commands to find linguistic patterns in corpora (e.g., consonant triplets, past-tense inflections) and to collect frequency counts. To show how these techniques can also be used outside linguistics, we will use them to collect text statistics in a authorship attribution exercise.
