## Day 2: Data Capta

An introduction on the use of digital tools in historical disciplines by
Charles van den Heuvel will be followed by a hands-on session under the
guidance of Jan Hartmann to get acquainted with the open-access Geographical Information System QGIS. Using historical maps of the Atlas der Neederlanden (UB) you will exercise in making your own maps and learn how to link geo-located data to a map from instance from an Excel spread sheet. After this experiment with mapping data in time and space,
the second part of this afternoon will be dedicated to the visualization of
topical data in historical network research. After a brief explanation of basic terms used in network visualizations and a demonstration of some examples hereof, we will experiment with the visualization tool Gephi to visualize a data set of Dutch correspondents from the Catalogus
Epistularum Neerlandicarum.
